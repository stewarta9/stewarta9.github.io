<td>Abstract</td>
<td>The combination of CAD, CAM, and CIM is what makes manufacturing clothes so much more efficient. It also makes it easier to create consistent quality products. The combination of these three systems also make it easier for companies to adjust to the swift change in trends. Computer Aided Manufacturing and Computer Aided Design allows designers to make changes to designs or patterns without having to start from scratch. CAD also allows designers to use softwares like 3D visualizations to make sure that the designs are detailed and as desired. CAM creates the designs into data and actually manufactures the designs.Computer Intergrated Manufacturing reads the CAD data and make sure that each machinery completes it's desired tasks efficiently and with the least amount of time. Computer Aided Design, Manufacturing, and Intergrated Manufacturing have become the new standard in order to compete in the ever growing fashion industry.   </td>

<td>Abstract</td>
<td>Computer Integrated Manufacturing help the fashion industry because it creates systems that control production, marketing, inventory, waste reduction, support functions, and enhance efficency. This is the most important part of technology in fashion because it's the brain of the body, it tells each individual thing what it should be doing. It tracks customer interaction on social media and online stores, so it can tell the company what they should produce more or less of. It tells the companies what's selling out and what isn't being bought. It's telling the companies which designs should be redesigned and potential ways to redesign it based on customer likes. It tells the engineering production which machine completes which tasks and in what order. </td>
