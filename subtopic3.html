<td>Abstract</td>
<td>The increase of technology in the fashion industry has also increased their levels of water consumption and global carbon emissions. Fast fashion is the rapid process of designing, producing, and distributing clothes at low cost. The biggest companies in fast fashion are Shein, H&M, Forever 21, UNIQLO, and Zara. Fast fashion's makes up 10% of the global carbon mission, which is the same amount as the European Union. Water pollution has also been on the rise because the syntheic fibers found in materials of fast fashion clothing have been mixing with the water supply when clothes are being washed. The freshwater levels are also being lowered because it's being used for fiber production. Fossil fuel energy is also being used to in the production process to make plastic fibers into textiles.  </td>

<td>Abstract</td>
<td>Technology has changed the process of buying clothes. For starters technology has revolutionized online shopping and social media because it has intergrated with AR and VR systems, which impacts how we select what we buy. AR and VR systems allow people to virtually try on clothings and accessories before they actually buy the clothes. 3D body scanning and modeling is incorportated in the AR and VR systems in order for us to try on the virtual pieces. This will also reduce returns because people can actually see what it would look like on them as if they were in a fitting room at a physical store. Technology has also made social media the main tool for fashion vrains to advertise their products and engage with customers. Companies can keep track of consumers dislikes and likes based on likes and comments on posts and reactions to endorsement deals on social media. Online shopping also makes it easier for us to buy things in any part of the world at an incredibly fast pace. In the past it could take months to receive something from China, now it takes no more than 2 weeks. 3D printing also impacted the fashion industry because it made it possible for us to create more unique patterns on clothing which wouldn't be possible before. Recycled materials and biodegradable plastic clothing has also increased with the new forms of technology in the fashion industry. Recycled materials results in lowering the amount of pollution that is being released into the war because less amounts of clothing are being thrown away. </td>
