<td>Abstract</td>
<td>This article discusses how fashion design software helps with fashion on demand. 3D modeling and computer aided design is a software that is designed to electronically create, visualize, and manipulate fashion designs. Computer aided design also makes it possible for digital fabric printing. This opens the network of fabric options because a designer can literally create a new fabric pattern and have it printed. This helps with the increase of personalized designs and eliminates only being able to buy ready-to-wear retail. One can specify their desired design from pattern, size, and color. This intertwines with social media and virtual events because this has created a greater need for virtual fashion options leading to the increase of digital fashion design systems. This has a positive effect on the environment because less materials are being produced and wasted. </td>

<td>Abstract</td>
<td>3D fashion design makes the fashion industry more efficient because it saves money on samples and production. When garments are created many samples are made and cut to reach a final product, resulting in massive fabric waste and high labor. 3D fashion design eliminates this by allowing artists to digitally customize garments based on all different body shapes without using fabric at all. 3D fashion design also expanded into VR and AR setting because with this new technology they are able to create virtual showcases and have online stores. 3D Fashion also helps expand 3D fashion design education globally, seeing as though you can learn everything onliine and you don't have to person to person interactions. This will also boarden one's networking system because they will have access to work with more people worldwide remotely.   </td>
